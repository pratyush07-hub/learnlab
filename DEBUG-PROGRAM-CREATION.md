# Program Creation Debug Guide

I've implemented comprehensive debugging for the program creation issue you're experiencing. Here's what I've done and how to test:

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
- Made `mentor_id` nullable in programs table with `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to make `mentor_id` optional
- Enhanced database schema with proper constraints and RLS policies

### 2. Admin Portal Enhancements ✅
- Fixed program creation form to use `undefined` instead of hardcoded 'admin' for mentor_id
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout the creation flow
- Enhanced ProgramService with detailed Supabase error reporting
- Added Supabase connection testing to admin dashboard

### 3. Debug Tools Created ✅
- Created test script (`test-program-creation.js`) for isolated testing
- Enhanced error logging in admin dashboard with connection validation

## How to Debug the Issue

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open your admin dashboard
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Try creating a program and watch for detailed error messages

### Step 2: Run the Test Script
```bash
cd c:\codebase\skillorbitx\learnlab.skillorbitx
node test-program-creation.js
```

This will test:
- Supabase connection
- Programs table accessibility  
- Direct program creation
- Cleanup

### Step 3: Check Supabase Database
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Check if the database schema has been updated with nullable mentor_id
3. Look at the programs table structure
4. Check RLS policies

## Expected Behavior

The admin should now be able to create programs because:
- `mentor_id` is nullable (allows NULL values)
- Admin form sets `mentor_id` to `undefined` (becomes NULL in database)
- Enhanced error logging shows exactly what's failing

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Database Schema Not Updated**: Ensure Supabase database has the updated schema
2. **RLS Policies**: Admin should have bypass policies for program creation
3. **Environment Variables**: Check if Supabase URL and keys are correct
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Build should be successful (already verified)

## Next Steps

1. Try creating a program in admin dashboard and check console logs
2. Run the test script to isolate the issue
3. If still failing, share the exact error messages from console

The enhanced logging will show exactly where the failure occurs in the creation flow.
